						<h3>How Podosea Started</h3>
						<span>
						The Korean maritime industry has showed continued growth despite the difficult situations home and abroad. However, despite possessing one of the world’s biggest maritime industries, the digital infrastructure of the domestic market has struggled to keep up. The lack of accessibility to information faced by both individuals and companies has led to information sharing becoming centered around offline networks.<br>
We felt the need to gather companies with the country's best technical prowess and services onto one platform, a place where online promotion and non-contact cooperation was possible. Podosea was created with the hope of becoming the gateway for the growth and overseas expansion of Korea maritime companies.

				Once, the oceans were a source of fear for humanity.<br>
Rough waves and sunken rocks may strand our ships, but they are also obstacles we must overcome.<br>
We hope Podosea will not be a place of fear and intimidation, but a place of sharing which everyone can enjoy.<br>
Let's all sail through the PodoSea together.
